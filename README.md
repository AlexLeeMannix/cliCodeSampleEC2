# cliCodeSampleEC2
My sample is written in Javascript using Node and Express. Command houses the CLI tool I built to take in user input, specifically the AWS Access Key Id, Secret Access Key, and Region, to gain access to the users AWS data. Server establishes the routes necessary to retrieve EC2 data (this version of code deals specifically with EC2 data) and serve it to the front end.
